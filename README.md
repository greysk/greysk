### Hi there 👋

My public, personally created repositories include:

- [graeScripts](https://github.com/greysk/graeScripts): My first public repository made as a 'catch-all' collection of Python scripts I wrote for myself.
- collegeWork (coming soon): A public version of my private notes and projects associated with obtaining my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.
