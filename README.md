### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My public, personally created repositories include:

- [graeScripts](https://github.com/greysk/graeScripts): My first public repository made as a 'catch-all' collection of Python scripts I wrote for myself.
- [collegeWork](https://github.com/greysk/collegeWork): Some scripts and projects associated with obtaining my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.
- [ImageFiMan](https://github.com/greysk/ImageFiMan): A C# .NET Windows (WPF) image viewing app written over 8 weeks for my Bachelor's Capstone.
